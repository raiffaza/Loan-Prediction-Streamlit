## Business Problem
Financial institutions need a reliable way to determine whether a loan application from a potential borrower should be approved or rejected. A well-designed loan approval process helps minimize the risk of non-performing loans and ensures that only financially viable applicants are approved.

Manual processes are time-consuming, subject to human bias, and can struggle to keep up with a high volume of applications. In addition, traditional methods may not be able to scale effectively as the number of applications increases.

Using automation through machine learning can address these challenges and bring greater efficiency, fairness, and speed to the loan evaluation process.
